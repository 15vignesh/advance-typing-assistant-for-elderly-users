The provided model architecture is designed for next-word prediction or language modeling. Let's break down how this model can be used for predicting the next word and the basis of its predictions:
1. **Embedding Layer:**
   - The Embedding layer converts words (represented as integers) into dense vectors of fixed size. Each word from the vocabulary is transformed into a 10-dimensional vector in this case.
2. **LSTM Layers:**
   - The first LSTM layer processes the sequential data from the Embedding layer with 1000 memory units and returns sequences (due to `return_sequences=True`). It captures contextual information and relationships among words in the input sequences.
   - The second LSTM layer continues to learn and capture more complex patterns and dependencies from the sequences with another set of 1000 memory units.
3. **Dense Layers:**
   - The Dense layer with ReLU activation (having 1000 units) introduces non-linearity and performs a transformation of the LSTM outputs into a higher-dimensional space.
   - The final Dense layer with a Softmax activation function generates a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary (vocab_size). This distribution predicts the likelihood of each word in the vocabulary being the next word given the context provided by the previous words.
4. **Prediction Basis:**
   - To predict the next word, you would input a sequence of three words (as specified by `input_length=3` in the Embedding layer) into the model.
   - The Embedding layer maps each word to its learned dense vector representation.
   - The LSTM layers process and learn the sequential patterns and relationships within the embedded sequences.
   - The final Dense layer uses the Softmax activation to compute the probability distribution of the next word in the vocabulary.
   - The word with the highest probability in the output distribution is considered as the predicted next word.
The basis for predicting the next word relies on the learned context of the preceding three words and the patterns observed during the training phase. The model learns from the provided text data and attempts to predict the most probable next word given the context it has been trained on.
During inference (prediction), you'd provide a sequence of three words, and the model would generate a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary. The word with the highest probability in this distribution is the predicted next word.
The model makes its predictions based on the learned representations of words, sequential patterns, and the relationships it learned during the training process, aiming to predict the most likely word that follows a given sequence of words based on the underlying patterns it has captured.
